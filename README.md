# Design-trajectory-planning-and-control-of-a-3-axis-cartesian-robot
The project involved designing, modeling, and simulating a 3-axis Cartesian robot (HBOT). Using SOLIDWORKS for design and assembly, and Simulink and Simscape Multibody for motion simulation, it included trajectory planning and control based on the robot's kinematics.
